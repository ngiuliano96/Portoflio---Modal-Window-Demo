        <h1>Iron | Fe | 26 | 55.845</h1>
        <p>
          A chemical element with the symbol Fe and atomic number 26. It is a
          metal that is commonly found in the Earth's crust, and it is essential
          for many industrial and biological processes. Iron is a strong and
          versatile material, and it is used in the construction of buildings,
          bridges, and vehicles. It is also a critical component of steel, which
          is used in the production of many consumer goods. Iron is also
          important for the human body, as it is a component of hemoglobin, a
          protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body.
          Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, a condition in which the body does
          not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen.

        <h1>Copper | Cu | 29 | 63.546</h1>
        <p>
          A chemical element with the symbol Cu and atomic number 29. It is a
          soft, malleable, and ductile metal with a reddish-orange color. Copper
          is an excellent conductor of electricity and heat, which makes it a
          valuable material in electrical wiring, plumbing, and other industrial
          applications. It is also an essential nutrient for humans and animals,
          playing a role in various physiological processes. Copper has a long
          history of use by humans, dating back to ancient civilizations such as
          the Egyptians and the Greeks, and it continues to be an important
          material in modern society.

        <h1>Tin | Sn | 50 | 118.71</h1>
        <p>
          A chemical element with the symbol Sn and atomic number 50. It is a
          silvery-white metal that is malleable, ductile, and non-toxic. Tin has
          been used by humans since ancient times, and it has various
          applications in modern industry. One of the most common uses of tin is
          in the production of tinplate, which is used for making food and
          beverage cans. Tin is also used as an alloying element in bronze,
          pewter, and other alloys, and it is used as a coating material for
          other metals to prevent corrosion. Tin has low toxicity, which makes
          it useful in many consumer products such as solder, dental fillings,
          and even as a food additive.
